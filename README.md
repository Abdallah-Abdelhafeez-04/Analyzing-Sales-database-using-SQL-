# Analyzing-Sales-database-using-SQL-
MS SQL Server project featuring a Sales database (SalesDB) with Customers, Products, Orders, and related tables. Includes sample data with intentional errors for data cleaning, queries for analysis, and database objects such as views, procedures, and triggers.
#  MS SQL Server Sales Database Project

##  Project Overview
This project is a **Microsoft SQL Server database solution** that builds a complete sales management database (`SalesDB`).  
It contains multiple tables with realistic sample data — including intentional inconsistencies to practice **data cleaning and validation**.  

The project demonstrates:
- Database design & relationships
- Data insertion with test records
- Queries for reporting and analysis
- Views, stored procedures, and functions
- Triggers and transactions for business logic

- **OrderDetails** → Line items for each order.  
- **Sales** → Tracks sales transactions and totals.  

### Features
- **Constraints**: Primary keys, foreign keys, unique, and check constraints

- **Queries**: SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY  
- **Views**: Simplified access to combined data  
- **Stored Procedures**: Automating repetitive tasks (e.g., sales reports)  
- **Functions**: Reusable database logic
